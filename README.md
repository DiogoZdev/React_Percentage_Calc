# Percentage Calculator

This project was the first attempt to learn ReactJS.
Very simple, probably several issues, but I'll keep it here to remember from where I started.

It contains a simple 2 field-form where you must:
- Enter a value
- Enter a percentage

The result will be shown in real time.
